### Course description

The first three weeks of this class will requi

This is an experimental course, in which you will have a chance to 
direct your own learning. k

You might want to think of this as a history class mashed up with a shop 
class.

## Learning goals

After taking this course, you will be able to

+ craft a digital history project

## The intellectual work of the course

The main work of this class will be a **digital research project**, 
produced in collaboration with your colleagues in the class. No less 
than the papers you write for other history classes, this project will 
be grounded in primary sources, conversant with secondary sources, and 
driven by an argument. You will have to do a lot of research and writing 
for this project, and you will learn the skills to create a digital 
project along the way. 

The digital project will be about mapping religion in greater Boston 
over time and space. Exactly what that will entail will be up to you. 
It might help you to think of the assignment as a project that you, the 
historians and developers, are creating for me, the client. You will be 
working in small teams, which I will assign early in the course.
There will be several steps along the way. First, by the end of 
week 3, your group will present a *project proposal/contract*, which 
will specify the historical sources and technologies that the project 
will use, the goals that the project will accomplish, and the specific 
duties of each team member. Second, beginning in week 4, your group will 
give brief project updates each week in class. Third, in week 11, we 
will collaboratively draft a *standards for evaluating projects*, based 
on DHjprojects funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities 
Office of Digital Humanities and created by DH shops at other 
universities. Fourth, your group will make a *formal 
presentation* of your work on the last day of class.

This research project will be *a lot of work*, almost all of it directed 
and motivated by you---always with my encouragement, help, and support 
along the way. At the end of the semester you will have created a piece 
of scholarship of which you can be proud.
