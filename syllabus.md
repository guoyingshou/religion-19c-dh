## Course description

During the American Revolution and the following decades, the state and
federal governments cut their financial and constitutional support for
established churches. Though many at the time predicted the demise of
Christianity, the result was a flowering of an astonishing diversity of
religions. In this course you will read the writings of the many
individuals and groups that lived out their religion in the
nineteenth-century United States: the alliance of skeptics and believers
who supported disestablishment; Baptist and Methodists revivalists;
Catholic priests, missionaries, and animists; founders of new religions
such as Mormonism and Christian Science; Reform and Orthodox Jews;
African-Americans; metaphysicians; liberal and conservative Protestants;
agnostics and atheists. We will make sense of that diversity by asking
and answering a set of unifying questions: How did mainstream and
minority faiths relate to one another, especially in the public sphere?
How did people experience religion in their everyday lives? How did
religious people change laws and society? How did new forms of religious
expression develop? How were new religions founded? How were religions
imported from Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America, and how did those
religions adapt? How did Americans become more religious and more
secular at the same time?

The centerpiece of this class will be a digital history project: you
will do your own original research into nineteenth-century sources to
make a digital map of religion in Boston over the nineteenth century.
Creating this project will teach you the skills of a
historian---researching, writing, analyzing---and will let you put what
you'll learn in this class to work on the ground. In this history class
as shop class, you'll also learn digital and project
skills---publishing, mapping, encoding, collaborating, communicating,
managing---that are widely useful in government, business, and research
outside the academy.

You can get a sense of the kind of work that we will do in this class by
examining these digital history mapping projects (starred projects are
especially impressive):

This class is divided into three phases: *bootstrapping* (weeks 1--3),
in which you will quickly gain a basic competency in the history of
American religion, historical research skills, and the scholarly
techniques and technologies of the digital humanities; *building* (weeks
4--13), in which you will slowly build a deeper knowledge of religious
history while you build the digital project; and *beta* (week 14), in
which you will release the beta version of the digital project, and with
it your own interpretation of nineteenth-century religion.

## Learning goals

After taking this course, you will be able to

-   explain the main themes of American religious history in the 19th
    century as they relate to many different denominations and
    religions;
-   interpret the primary sources of American religious history;
-   conduct original historical research in nineteenth-century primary
    sources;
-   work collaboratively using the tools and techniques of digital
    humanities to create digital scholarship;
-   conceive of and build a large scale digital project; and
-   write effectively for a public audience.

## The intellectual work of the course

The main work of this class will be a **digital research project**,
produced in collaboration with your colleagues in the class. No less
than the papers you write for other history classes, this project will
be grounded in primary sources, conversant with secondary sources, and
driven by an argument. You will have to do a lot of research and writing
for this project, and you will learn the skills to create a digital
project along the way.

The digital project will be about mapping religion in greater Boston
over time and space. Exactly what that will entail will be up to you. It
might help you to think of the assignment as a project that you, the
historians and developers, are creating for me, the client. You will be
working in small teams, which I will assign early in the course. There
will be several steps along the way. First, by the end of week 3, your
group will present a **project proposal/contract**, which will specify
the historical sources and technologies that the project will use, the
goals that the project will accomplish, and the specific duties of each
team member. Second, beginning in week 4 your group will give brief
project updates each week in class. Third, in week 11, we will
collaboratively draft **standards for evaluating projects**, based on DH
projects funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities Office of
Digital Humanities and created by DH shops at other universities.
Fourth, your group will make a **formal presentation** of your work
during the final examination period.

The other main work you will do is **reading and discussing** American
religious history in the nineteenth century. In the first three weeks of
the class, you will read Butler, Wacker, and Ballmer's survey history of
American religion and a more detailed history of an American religious
tradition of your choice (see below), and you will **write a review**
(6--8 pages) comparing the two books. For each class period in weeks 4
to 14, you will **read primary sources**, which you must be prepared to
discuss. By 10 a.m. before class each day, you should **e-mail the class
list** to identify one thing you learned from the texts, and one
question that you have about them. You can do this in no more than a
paragraph. These e-mails will help me tailor the class to your
interests.

Because this class is collaborative and self-directed, much of the
communication between you and your colleagues, and between you and me,
will happen on the **course blog**. Beginning in week 3, you will write
a minimum of one brief blog post per week, describing the work you've
done on the digital project. (You can write as many posts as you like.)
Topics can include the research you're doing, the skills you're
learning, the decisions you're making, the connections you're drawing to
the class readings, and the like.

This class will be much more informal and collaborative than any
humanities class that you have taken before. Part of this informality is
that you can expect that we might change the assignments for the course
as we go along. You can be certain, for example, that the contract you
will draw up will obligate you to accomplishing certain work at certain
times during the course, and so this work is not on the schedule below.
You can also expect that as work on the main project proceeds I might
modify the readings for the course to help your work on the project. In
any case you will be doing your own research---and thus your own reading
in primary and secondary works---which you should also be prepared to
discuss at various times in class.

## Evaluation

The assignments for this course will receive these weights. For
assignments which are collaborative, your grade will be determined both
by your individual contribution and by the overall quality of the
project.

  assignment                 weight
  -------------------------- --------
  digital research project   40%
  presentation of project    10%
  readings and discussions   30%
  book review                10%
  blogging                   10%
