% U.S. Religion in the 19th Century:  
  A Digital History Seminar
% Lincoln A. Mullen

### Course description

The first three weeks of this class will requi

This is an experimental course, in which you will have a chance to
direct your own learning. k

You might want to think of this as a history class mashed up with a shop
class.

This class is divided into three phases: *bootstrapping* (weeks 1--3), 
in which you will quickly gain a basic competency in the history of 
American religion, historical research skills, and the scholarly 
techniques and technologies of the digital humanities; *building* (weeks 
4--13), in which you will slowly build a deeper knowledge of religious 
history while you build the digital project; and *beta* (week 14), in 
which you will release the beta version of the digital project, and with 
it your own beta interpretation of nineteenth-century religion.^[Jeremy 
Boggs: "History is a perpetual beta."] 

## Learning goals

After taking this course, you will be able to

-   explain the main themes of American religious history in the 19th
    century as they relate to many different denominations and
    religions;
-   interpret the primary sources of American religious history;
-   conduct original research in nineteenth-century primary sources;
-   work collaboratively using the tools and techniques of digital
    humanities to create digital scholarship; and
-   write effectively for an Internet audience.

## The intellectual work of the course

The main work of this class will be a **digital research project**,
produced in collaboration with your colleagues in the class. No less
than the papers you write for other history classes, this project will
be grounded in primary sources, conversant with secondary sources, and
driven by an argument. You will have to do a lot of research and writing
for this project, and you will learn the skills to create a digital
project along the way.

The digital project will be about mapping religion in greater Boston
over time and space. Exactly what that will entail will be up to you. It
might help you to think of the assignment as a project that you, the
historians and developers, are creating for me, the client. You will be
working in small teams, which I will assign early in the course. There
will be several steps along the way. First, by the end of week 3, your
group will present a **project proposal/contract**, which will specify
the historical sources and technologies that the project will use, the
goals that the project will accomplish, and the specific duties of each
team member. Second, beginning in week 4, your group will give brief
project updates each week in class. Third, in week 11, we will
collaboratively draft a **standards for evaluating projects**, based on
DHjprojects funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities Office
of Digital Humanities and created by DH shops at other universities.
Fourth, your group will make a **formal presentation** of your work on
the last day of class.

This research project will be *a lot of work*, almost all of it directed
and motivated by you---always with my encouragement, help, and support
along the way. At the end of the semester you will have created a piece
of scholarship of which you can be proud.

The other main work you will do is **reading and discussing** American
religious history in the nineteenth century. In the first three weeks of
the class, you will read Butler, Wacker, and Ballmer's survey history of
American religion and a more detailed history of an American religious
tradition of your choice (see below), for which you will write a review
(5--7 pages) comparing the two books. For each class period in weeks 4
to 14, you will read some primary sources for each class period, which
you must be prepared to discuss in class.

Because this class is so collaborative and self-directed, a lot of the
communication between you and your colleagues, and between you and me,
will happen on the **course blog**. Beginning in week 3, you will write
a minimum of one brief blog post per week, describing the work you've
done on the digital project. (You can write as many posts as you like.)
Topics can includes the research you're doing, the skills you're
learning, the decisions you're making, the connections you're drawing to
the class readings, etc. You will also make at least two comments per
week on your colleagues' posts.

## Evaluation

The assignments for this course will receive these weights.

  assignment                 weight
  -------------------------- --------
  digital research project   50%
  presentation of project    10%
  readings and discussions   20%
  book review                10%
  blogging                   10%

For assignments which are collaborative, your grade will be determined
both by your individual contribution and by the overall quality of the
project.
