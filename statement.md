% Nineteenth-Century American Religion: A Digital History Seminar
% Lincoln A. Mullen

The topic of this course is closely linked to my dissertation.

This course also fits in with my particular strengths as an instructor.

The pedagogy is innovative in that the semester project produces
valuable scholarship at the end. Teaches skills: digital scholarship:
writing in public. These are not taught at the expense of existing
skills---the same kind of research will be required.

The nature of digital humanities work is inherently interdisciplinary.
But this course remains firmly grounded in disciplinary research.

Judging by previous class enrollment figures, Brandeis students are
interested in classes on religion (see table below). Classes offered in
religious history or cognate disciplines usually exceed twenty enrolled
students. Professors Cadge and Brooten's class on "Religion in Greater
Boston" drew considerably higher enrollment; that class had a similar 
theme to the project for this course.

In terms of class content, the History Department has only rarely 
offered undergraduate courses in the history of American religion.

Brandeis has offered no comparable course in the digital humanities,
though other . If the digital humanities is about building things, as
one leading practitioner has defined it, then the project in this class
will be a good introduction to the emerging field.[^1]
