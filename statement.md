Introductory paragraph

The topic of this course is closely linked to my dissertation. 

This course also fits in with my particular strengths as an instructor.


The pedagogy is innovative in that the semester project produces 
valuable scholarship at the end. Teaches skills:
  digital scholarship:
  writing in public. These are not taught at the expense of existing 
  skills---the same kind of research will be required. 

The nature of digital humanities work is inherently interdisciplinary. 
But this course remains firmly grounded in disciplinary research.

Judging by previous class enrollment figures, Brandeis students are 
interested in classes on the history of religion. "American Judaism" 
(NEJS {TODO}) and "Farrelly's course" were {TODO}. There are no 
comparable courses on digital history or digital humanities.
